# Flutter-Task-Manager-Application
 I am currently working on a comprehensive project utilizing the Flutter framework alongside a REST API. Within this project, users have the ability to create accounts, update account information, add tasks with statuses, delete tasks, and perform other related actions. The app has been implemented using the GetX state management approach.
